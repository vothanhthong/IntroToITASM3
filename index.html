            computer by writing some code and making it run. So I wanted to
            become a software developer in the future. From that moment, I had
            been trying to learn coding and the first programming language that
            I learned is Pascal. In my free time, I watch some coding challenges
            of Google or Microsoft on Youtube to know the way people solve the
            problem and improve my coding skills.” <br />

            it did grow on me. Naturally since my interest didn’t particularly

            there wasn’t a particular event of person that piqued my interest,

              Personally speaking, we think the audit trail did not properly
              reflect our group’s work, at least not the processes that happened
              in between production of our project. Instead of all members
              publishing their work into the public repository made by/for our
              group - which in turn may make it more difficult to navigate
              through said repository – we have decided to collect information
              and files via other methods, such as email, instant online
              messaging apps, etc. this way, only important data will be
              published into our group’s repository. It does, however, shows
              that our team has at the very least, completed the given tasks.

              The IT world is varied among different positions and also it
              involves many changes day by day. From the interview with an IT
              professional - Pham Trung Kien, we have got a chance to listen to
              his daily tasks and collect some specific information.
            </p>
            <p>
              His work starts from the beginning of the week with a meeting with
              the Project team to receive the tasks back to his department.
              After having organised the tasks for each day and the whole week,
              his team will start dealing with their jobs individually. As a
              leader of a finance team for the project, beside dealing with his
              own tasks, he is also responsible for backing up other team
              members and reviewing the code program.
            </p>
            <p>
              Talking about those people he usually interacts with, he spends
              most of his time working with team members in project departments
              such as those from the finance team, backend developers, mobile
              team, EA and testers while his superiors like technical leaders
              and project managers are responsible for working on-site with
              clients, sales administrators and sometimes investors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sharing about the workplace, he spends an average of 7-8 hours per
              day working at the office, from 8 a.m to about 4-5 p.m. When there
              are strict deadlines, an IT professional may need to stay at the
              workplace for 8-9 hours per day in order to catch up with the
              tasks and support other colleagues as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the most challenging aspects from his position is probably
              the changes in the clients’ requests. He explained that once
              everything has been set up and run smoothly, a change in clients’
              requests may cause a variety of conflicts affecting the old parts
              that are running stably. When there are changes from customers,
              the IT professionals will need to calculate how to change the
              program so that it still runs smoothly and maintain the same
              effectiveness of the project as before.

          <div class="section-content">
            <h4>1. Cloud Computing</h4>
            <p>
              Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services
              - this includes servers, storage, databases, networking, software,
              intelligence, and analytics – over “the cloud” (the internet) to
              increase flexibility and scalability. Cloud computing in general
              offers remote access to any work-related data, an example of this
              is how programmers can save their codes online in GitHub. Cloud
              adoption has seen “a sharp rise” (Kreigh, 2021, p. 111) during the
              height of 2020’s Corona-induced pandemic. Providers are currently
              researching on how to efficiently use cloud computing to deal with
              the numerous machine-to-machine communication, data, process, etc.
              The main enabling technology for cloud computing is
              virtualization. Virtualization software works as a separator. It
              divides one single –physical- computing device into one or more
              virtual devices, each of which can be easily manipulated to
              perform computing tasks. This in turn, enables the providers to
              virtualize servers, storages and other physical hardware or data
              center resources.
            </p>
            <p>
              From an objective point of view, cloud computing is a young field,
              with exponential potential growth. Cloud computing itself is very
              versatile, enables many different directions to take. With that
              being said, cloud computing is undoubtedly impactful at the very
              least to society as it had increased the competitiveness of IT
              services available to the public and private alike. This in turn
              creates a substantial number of opportunities leading to new
              services (more jobs), which further prove the versatility of cloud
              computing as a job and as a field itself. as long as there is
              internet connection, you can always use cloud services (either for
              storage or computing), so cloud computing affects us all as a
              whole rather than a niche in society.
            </p>
            <p>
              From a subjective point of view however, cloud computing had been
              a big help for me, especially since I am a programmer, and to be
              able to save your codes online is a luxury. I have always been
              used to cloud computing so my life is mostly unaffected with it,
              but without it, life can be quite troublesome. Cloud computing
              helps people stay in contact with each other, for example my
              friends and I, follow events or news, etc.
            </p>
            <h4>2. Cybersecurity and privacy</h4>
            <p>
              Cybersecurity, in its simplest term, is the practice of protecting
              programs, systems, and networks from digital attacks.
              Cybersecurity is a volatile field, with an “average 270 attacks
              per company over the year, a 31% increase over 2020. Third-party
              risk continues to dominate, with successful breaches to the
              organization through the supply chain have increased from 44% to
              61%” (D.H.James, 2020, p. 11). Cybersecurity ensures the privacy
              of users remain, “private”, this includes several actions to
              ensure minimum breach: prevention of unauthorized data/personnel;
              regulatory compliance; regular intervals of verifying data’s
              integrity; etc. The logarithmic growth rate of Cybersecurity has
              led many people to believe that AI will soon be the “core
              component of all cybersecurity, be it offline or online, systems”
              (D.H.James, 2020, p. 99). Cybersecurity was “invented” in the
              1970s, when two men – Bob “Creeper” Thomas and Ray “Reaper”
              Tomlinson – created two different programs – Creeper and Reaper
              respectively – to move over a network. Mr. Bob discovered that
              when a computer program moves over a network, it leaves behind a
              trail, he then created Creeper, so that the trail printed out a
              simple message “I’M THE CREEPER: CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.” This
              concerned a lot of people, including leading programming
              specialist of MIT – Ray Tomlinson- Ray then created Reaper for the
              sole purpose of catching and destroying Creeper.

              Cybersecurity prevents malicious actions (hacking) to be taken
              place in users’ devices. This in turns pushed the “hackers” to
              grow as a community, this also led to the inevitable growth of
              technologies in general. the growth of the black hat community
              will naturally lead to the growth of the cybersecurity community.
              This contrasting relationship is the fundamental push for the
              never-ending growth of technologies. Cybersecurity requires new
              services to be needed, therefore creating more jobs and
              opportunities to grow.

            <p>
              The existence of cybersecurity serves not only as a beacon of
              “security”, but also a symbol of “changes”. Cybersecurity provides
              many people, including my family and I, online security, where
              almost all the people you’ve met or will eventually meet are
              strangers with different agendas. Personally, it had helped me and
              people I know going through my and their daily life, respectively,
              without worrying about being hacked or breached by random hackers.

            <h4>3. Autonomous vehicle</h4>
            <p>
              Autonomous vehicle, with a self-explanatory name, create and
              maintain a map of their surroundings based on a variety of sensors
              situated in different parts of the vehicle. Radar sensors monitor
              the position of nearby vehicles; video cameras detect traffic
              lights, read road signs, track other vehicles, and look for
              pedestrians and so on. This technology has been in development
              since the 1920s, with the first full-fledged autonomous vehicle –
              the AutoMobile – appeared around 1980s. There is a guiding
              framework of standards for measuring autonomous vehicle
              capabilities, with five levels of vehicle autonomy as defined by
              the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). They range from human
              control (level 0 autonomy) to full autonomous (level 5 autonomy).
              Tesla’s pilot, for example, is considered level 2 autonomy, which
              means a driver is still needed to takeover; while the Waymo
              project from Google operates at level 4 autonomy, meaning it is
              only 1 step away from being a true autonomous vehicle.
              Self-driving vehicles employ a wide range of technologies like
              radar, cameras, ultrasound, radio antennas, etc. to navigate
              safely on the roads.
            </p>
            <p>
              Autonomous has left behind massive impacts upon the job market,
              the general business, the health system and many more systems
              alike. Autonomous vehicle, like many other areas in IT, is growing
              exponentially. We’re expecting Tesla’s pilot, for example, to
              reach level 3 autonomy by the end of 2025. Autonomous vehicle had
              and will probably affect many jobs/fields. Autonomous vehicles can
              bring the end of truck drivers, taxi drivers, and so on, as there
              is not a need for a physical driver in order to takeover.
            </p>
            <p>
              Autonomous vehicle in general is not a big part of my life or my
              family. Soon, once the technology has been improved upon itself, I
              may just acquire it, purely out of curiosity.

            <h4>4. Chatbots</h4>
            <p>
              Chatbot is a computer program that stimulates a real life, human –
              hopefully natural – conversation. Users can interact with said
              chatbots via the chat interface or voice input. There are
              currently 3 main types. The simplest and probably the first type
              of chatbot invented - the rigid, multiple choices, rule-based
              chatbots. The others are more complicated. The Intellectually
              Independent Chatbots use machine learning to help them learn from
              users’ specific inputs and request – machine learning helps the
              bots recognize certain keywords that triggers certain replies,
              with the bots getting better and better overtime. The last and
              latest chatbots, which combined the best of both worlds, namely
              the rule-based bots and the machine learning bots, is called
              AI-powered chatbots. these latest models understand all languages,
              with their local memory works similarly like a cookie, saving both
              the context and the user’s preferences. These chatbots can also
              jump from one point of conversation scenario to another when
              needed and address random user request at any moment. In order to
              achieve this, these AI-Powered chatbots use a combination of
              machine learning, AI, and Natural Language Processing. NLP is the
              ability of the computer to understand and analyze human speech, to
              understand the inputted human language, therefore, find the right
              response and reply correctly to said human language. They have
              been widely considered as the “future of business communication”.
              This can be because businesses can now easily integrate chatbots
              into their social media channels to build customer relationships.
              This in turn, creates brand awareness and automate purchase
              processes, which can be very time and wit-consuming. With chatbots
              getting smarter the more they talk, thanks to AI and deep
              learning, said processes had become much simpler.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chatbots are important, especially to the people of the business
              world, where they are regarding it as the primary channel for
              marketing conversations. Since you can have chatbots talking to
              the users, without the need to pay for someone doing the job,
              chatbots had also negatively impacted society as “jobs regarding
              marketing have seen a sharp drop in the last quarter of 2014
              (total of -11%).” (J.D.Quagmire, 2019). Chatbots will get smarter
              and better overtime, because it can improve upon itself during
              real-time conversations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chatbots were not a big part of my experience growing up, neither
              was it present in my family throughout the years. I can only say
              chatbots, in its purest form, has helped many people overcome many
              things, or at the very least, had helped many businesses bloomed.

              After the discussion , the team come to the decision of a outfit
              costumize website that enables users to custom their own clothes.
              The website would include different types of clothes (or at least
              the most popular clothes pieces nowadays) with the customization
              including colors, shapes, small pieces of accessories, ... As the
              website’s purpose is to offer users chances to customize their own
              clothes according to their hobbies, it would also require a design
              department in order to create a successful website. This
              appearance is very important with this kind of website. The reason
              we think this website is interesting is that until now, there are
              still very few websites that enable users to customize their own
              clothes. This website give user opportunity to put their own style
              into the clothes. Everybody likes to own at least one piece of
              clothes that is unique and show their characteristics, their
              styles which no one can buy or find. The website would include a
              task bar with a large screen that presents the clothes design. The
              task bar would be placed on top of the website with different
              types of clothes such as pants, t-shirts, shirts, sweaters, ...
            </p>
            <p>
              As the users access the website, the first step is to choose what
              type of clothes they want to customize. As they click on the kind
              of clothes, the most basic image of that clothes would be
              presented on the customizing screen. At the bottom of the screen,
              at the same time, there will be a customizing bar displayed which
              might include colors for different parts of the clothes, shape,
              accessories and some simple images that users can choose to put on
              the clothes. The user can also insert the pictures from their
              devices to put on the clothes as their want according to their own
              style. We offers two main printing methods, screen printing and
              direct-to-garment (or digital) printing. Screen printing is the
              art of applying layers directly to a t-shirt, and
              direct-to-garment printing is handled by a garment printer that
              carefully applies ink to shirts. We promise to always use the best
              print method for your order’s unique needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              After finishing customizing their clothes, users can have a look
              at their finished product and decide to go to the payment process
              or not. If they have not yet satisfied with the products
              customized, users can always go back to the previous steps and
              start customizing their products again. If they have satisfied
              with the product and choose to pay for the clothes they make,
              customers can carry out the payment step and choose to take the
              product at the store or to have their products shipped. Other
              details needed to be included on the website probably the brand’s
              name (an unique name for the brand so that the customers can
              introduce to their friends if they want), contact details,
              including telephone number, email, address so that users can
              contact if they have any problems or questions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, there will be a report and contribution part for customers
              to send their reviews and comments to improve the experience for
              the users. There should also be a reviews part where customers can
              access and read reviews from other customers about the products as
              for online shopping, it is always very important to refer to
              comments and reviews before deciding to purchase something,
              especially clothes (customers always consider materials and the
              shape of There would be some foreseeable risk on the building
              stage of the project and the outcome as well. By hosting on
              GitHub, there will be no maintaining fee for the website. As the
              team have not had much experience, the coding member of the team
              had to learn new coding language to build the web. Furthermore,
              about the site responsive, we have to work on the desktop
              stylesheet and then the mobile styling later. At this stage, it
              would be difficult to rearrange layout of the elements. Our team
              still try our best to make the website standout from the other
              similar existed website and suitable for many user objects.

            <p>
              When I did assignment 2, my task is building the group website. I
              have to code everything from the beginning, so I face some
              problems which I have to do research online to solve. I have done
              our website 4 days before the deadline, but the content of the
              website is not completed. Although my team is not good at
              communication, all member tried their best to do the assignment on
              time. I think my team has to complete the next assignment as soon
              as possible to have time to review it before submitting it.
            </p>
            <span>Vu Phan Anh:</span>
            <p>
              Members are also quite candid and honest with one another, without
              being disrespectful, of course. My task is doing the Team Profile
              and the Project Idea so the main work I had to do is gathering
              information and do research about the idea of the team. The team
              did not have much time discussing as a whole group, which resulted
              in the lack connection in the team. Despite the fact that my team
              lacks communication skills, every member did their utmost to
              complete the task on time. My team should probably finish the next
              task as soon as feasible so that we may examine it before
              submitting it.

            <p>
              Everybody seemed to be quite well-coordinated, and thoughtful.
              Members are also very open and straightforward with each other, of
              course, without being rude. This acts as a fundamental force that
              drives all our team members forward; and thanks to that, we were
              able to complete the given tasks accordingly without much
              challenges.
            </p>
            <span>Nguyen Ngoc Khanh Linh:</span>
            <p>
              Generally, after about nearly 1 month working together, I saw that
              our team worked quite well. We all finished our tasks in time with
              the planned deadlines and also there were no argument among
              teammates. However, I think there is 1 drawback is that we did not
              really communicate effectively as a team. We just did our tasks
              separately and handed them back listening to the feedback. It
              would be much better if we can talk and interact more. However,
              since we had to work with the geographical distance as we are not
              all in Ho Chi Minh city, it is quite understandable. <br />
              To be specific: <br />
              Thong: I saw he did quite well his job and as a senior, he did
              support and take care us quite thoroughly so that the tasks would
              finish on time.He also contributed ideas to the project and took
              care of other teammates. We did communicate during the project.
              <br />
              Huu Dat: He finished the tasks on time but I have got chances to
              communicate with him a lot, probably as we had to work online so
              the interaction is limited. <br />
              Myself: The tasks I was assigned were finished on time and also I
              feel like I did communicate and listen from others.
