            it did grow on me. Naturally since my interest didn’t particularly
            “spike up” at any point, but rather gradually increasing over time,
            there wasn’t a particular event of person that piqued my interest,

              For the assignment 3, the group’s work is still based on the idea
              from Assignment 2 : Outfit Customize Website. We have always
              managed to maintain a more-than-needed level of communication just
              for that extra security. Except for the fact that one team member
              is currently not in the city, we have always managed to talk to
              each other at least once a day every time we have a group project,
              not only in the group chat, but also to each other in our
              respective private Direct Messages. We usually do have a meeting
              twice a week with participations always numbered to a neat 100%
              via any app that is useful (Zoom, Messenger, NOT Skype, etc.). For
              example, if there is a group member that does not respond to our
              communications, we will first shoulder said person’s
              responsibilities equally among the rest of the active members,
              then, should they contact us back soon enough, we will let them
              handle that work, or at least an equal amount of work so that
              everything remains fair. Should they not contact us back though,
              we will file the usual report to make sure that they do not get
              the marks they deserve.

              Thong’s ideal job is Front-end Developer, which requires applicant
              to have knowledge in many coding languages and some kinds of
              framework such as Angular, 6 ReactJS, or Scrum. It is better if

              experience with HTML/CSS, Javascript and be able to update the
              latest of all technologies. <br />
              Linh and Phan Anh share the same ideal job which is Data Analyst.
              When a company hires an entry-level data analyst, employers know
              that they will have to teach this person all of the essential
              skills needed to be able to properly work within the company. This
              is also why many of these companies have special training programs
              that are designed explicitly for people looking for beginner data
              analyst jobs.All of that being said, specific entry-level data
              analyst requirements are still important to keep in mind. These
              requirements include possession of analytical and critical
              thinking skills, being well-suited to work in a team, being great
              at maths,… <br />
              Dat’s ideal job is Quantum Physicist, in short, the physics that
              explains how everything works. It explores the nature of the
              particles that make up matter and the sheer force with which they
              interact. It’s the study of matter and energy at the most core
              level — explaining how electrons move through a microchip or how
              the sun is a consistent ball of fire. To be a physics major,
              you’ll need a high school diploma, ACT or SAT scores, transcripts
              and letters of recommendation. Before declaring a major in
              physics, students are asked to complete coursework in general
              physics, algebra and calculus. <br />
              Those who are looking for a PhD programme in physics with a focus
              on quantum physics should have a strong undergraduate and master’s
              background in physics with sufficient coursework in the domain. To
              add to that, an interest in independent research or a bachelor’s
              degree from an accredited college or university is also needed.
              <br />
              The career plans of each member are different but they are all in
              the IT industry. All the jobs require to have soft skills such as

            <p>
              Personally speaking, we think the audit trail did not properly
              reflect our group’s work, at least not the processes that happened
              in between production of our project. Instead of all members
              publishing their work into the public repository made by/for our
              group - which in turn may make it more difficult to navigate
              through said repository – we have decided to collect information
              and files via other methods, such as email, instant online
              messaging apps, etc. this way, only important data will be
              published into our group’s repository. It does, however, shows
              that our team has at the very least, completed the given tasks.

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              Topic <br />
              The website would include a task bar with a large screen that
              presents the clothes design. The task bar would be placed on top
              of the website with different types of clothes such as pants,
              t-shirts, shirts, sweaters, ... The website would include
              different types of clothes (or at least the most popular clothes
              pieces nowadays) with the customization including colors, shapes,
              small pieces of accessories, ... As the website’s purpose is to
              offer users chances to customize their own clothes according to
              their hobbies, it would also require a design department in order
              to create a successful website. This appearance is very important
              with this kind of website. <br />
              As the users access the website, the first step is to choose what
              type of clothes they want to customize. As they click on the kind
              of clothes, the most basic image of that clothes would be
              presented on the customizing screen. At the bottom of the screen,
              at the same time, there will be a customizing bar displayed which
              might include colors for different parts of the clothes, shape,
              accessories and some simple images that users can choose to put on
              the clothes. The user can also insert the pictures from their
              devices to put on the clothes as their want according to their own
              style. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Motivation <br />
              The reason we think this website is interesting is that until now,
              there are still very few websites that enable users to customize
              their own clothes. This website give user opportunity to put their
              own style into the clothes. Everybody likes to own at least one
              piece of clothes that is unique and show their characteristics,
              their styles which no one can buy or find. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Landscape <br />
              There are some typical Outfit customize websites that already
              existed such as customink.com, contrado.co.uk, spreadshirt.com,
              apliiq.com and a typical website that manufacturing in Vietnam is
              t-shirt-printing-vietnam.com. <br />
              These websites share a common thing is that they provide user to
              customize based on an existed product for only change the figure
              on the item. What make our website stands out is give user
              opportunity to have adjustment on the very detail parts of the
              outfits, which make the outfits unique. <br />
            </p>
            <h4>Detailed Description</h4>
            <p>
              Aims <br />
              The first intention of the team was only to working on the most
              feasible idea based on the team skills and abilities. The more we
              worked on the project, the more enthusiasm we put on the project.
              As the website provide user the easiest way to shopping clothes,
              with the unique and have not been developed before, we think the
              outcome website can probably change the way people shopping if it
              is developed intensively. <br />
              The aftermath of the Covid-19 outbreak has forced everyone to go
              online with their enterprises. People no longer like to purchase
              at a market or mall; instead, they prefer to search or browse
              online for new arrivals and accessories. This also allows them to
              save time and effort. A task bar with a large screen displaying
              the clothing design would be included on the website. The task bar
              would be placed on top of the website and would include various
              clothing items such as slacks, t-shirts, shirts, sweaters, and so
              on. When customers initially visit the website, they must first
              decide what style of clothing they want to create. When users
              select a type of clothing, the most basic image of that clothing
              is displayed on the customization screen. A customizing bar will
              be displayed at the bottom of the screen, which may include colors
              for different portions of the clothes, shape, accessories, and
              some simple graphics that users can pick to put on the outfits.
              The user has the option to insert figure and images from their
              mobile devices as well. Users can view their finished goods and
              decide whether or not to proceed to the payment procedure after
              finishing customizing their apparel. Users can always go back to
              the previous steps and start customizing their products again if
              they aren't content with the things they have created. Customers
              can complete the payment stage and choose whether to pick up their
              purchases in the store or have them mailed if they are satisfied
              with the product. <br />
              The process of customizing, checking, paying and shipping are
              provided to the users and how detail the users can customize as
              discussed above can really help us achieve our goal. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Plans and Progress <br />
              Each member of the group came up with different ideas for the
              group project at the start. According to the first and second
              assignments, each member has a different level of IT experience
              and interest. The ideas that we came up with from the start were
              an application for English learners, a science experiment
              simulator website, a website to create outfits, and a vector
              graphics application. Because only one team member has experience
              developing a website, we decided to build an Outfit customizable
              website, which will make it easy for the coding member while also
              being a practical notion. The reason we find this website
              intriguing is that there are still just a few websites that allow
              customers to personalize their own clothing. This website is
              fascinating since it allows users to personalize their outfits.
              Everyone wants to own at least one piece of clothing that is
              one-of-a-kind and reflects their personality and style in a way
              that no one else can. If people want to test their design ability
              and abilities, the website is also a location where they can use
              their ideas and creativity. <br />
              At the designing step, the team get worked together and decided
              what would displayed on the screen and what would happen as the
              users use the website. After that , the demo background of the
              website was presented in the presentation day and the other
              teammates kept working on the project to make it a completed
              website. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Roles <br />
              At the first stage of the project, the main thing the team was
              working on was the researching and designing to finish the demo to
              the project. At the first weeks, the group assigned jobs for each
              member to do the research on write the report. At the next step,
              Thong, the only member have much more experience in coding, worked
              mainly on the designing and building the website while other
              members continue on the writing and research part. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Scopes and limits <br />
              What we are aiming to do is simply working on introducing a more
              personalized “shopping” experience, specifically for people
              looking for an outfit that will scream out their name, an outfit
              that represents themselves when they put it on. The main basic
              thing that will need to be completed are basically the polishing
              process and smoothness of the website itself. So, the main product
              that we are going to introducing when it comes to “deliverability”
              of our project, will be a website that helps people customize
              clothes, with a sizable number of variants to choose from. <br />
              With that being said, there are a fair share of limits to our
              project. We do have lots of interesting ideas for this project,
              but since time is of the essence, we decided not to put some of
              them in as to not be over-ambitious and over-do what we were
              originally assigned to do (in a bad way). <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Testing <br />
              We have tested our project and proto-ran it a lot of times, mainly
              to polish it even further and beyond, to reach the stage that it
              deserved now. By testing, we simply ran the code for website, and
              to check for consistency error, validation error, etc. We have all
              tested it on people we personally know (that of course, have prior
              concrete knowledge about fashion) instead of normal acquaintances,
              which added up to 45 test users throughout 3 weeks (mid-Week 9 to
              mid-Week 12). We listened to the feedbacks and had further
              improved our website. <br />

            </p>
            <p>
              Risks <br />
              There are many risks, including: <br />
              • The website is not correctly optimized, in other words,
              suboptimal user interfaces with clunky and buggy client. <br />
              • The clothing is not “varied” enough, too monotonous. This is
              bound to happen, no matter how many pieces of unique clothing we
              will be able to obtain or at least manufactured, many people will
              have things to say about our “lack of unique clothing”. <br />
              • Many team members were not familiar with the technology at
              first, so there WAS a risk of one of us messing things up by,
              again, not being familiar with said technology. <br />
              • The project isn’t unique enough. This is more of a “generic”
              risk than any other, but still worth mentioning for the sole fact
              that our project may be uninteresting for some, especially those
              that do not care about how they look or what they wear. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Group processes and communications <br />
              We have always managed to maintain a more-than-needed level of
              communication just for that extra security. Except for the fact
              that one team member is currently not in the city, we have always
              managed to talk to each other at least once a day every time we
              have a group project, not only in the group chat, but also to each
              other in our respective private Direct Messages. We usually do
              have a meeting twice a week with participations always numbered to
              a neat 100% via any app that is useful (Zoom, Messenger, NOT
              Skype, etc.). For example, if there is a group member that does
              not respond to our communications, we will first shoulder said
              person’s responsibilities equally among the rest of the active
              members, then, should they contact us back soon enough, we will
              let them handle that work, or at least an equal amount of work so
              that everything remains fair. Should they not contact us back
              though, we will file the usual report to make sure that they do
              not get the marks they deserve. <br />

            <h4>1. Cloud Computing</h4>
            <p>
              Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services
              - this includes servers, storage, databases, networking, software,
              intelligence, and analytics – over “the cloud” (the internet) to
              increase flexibility and scalability. Cloud computing in general
              offers remote access to any work-related data, an example of this
              is how programmers can save their codes online in GitHub. Cloud
              adoption has seen “a sharp rise” (Kreigh, 2021, p. 111) during the
              height of 2020’s Corona-induced pandemic. Providers are currently
              researching on how to efficiently use cloud computing to deal with
              the numerous machine-to-machine communication, data, process, etc.
              The main enabling technology for cloud computing is
              virtualization. Virtualization software works as a separator. It
              divides one single –physical- computing device into one or more
              virtual devices, each of which can be easily manipulated to
              perform computing tasks. This in turn, enables the providers to
              virtualize servers, storages and other physical hardware or data
              center resources.
            </p>
            <p>
              From an objective point of view, cloud computing is a young field,
              with exponential potential growth. Cloud computing itself is very
              versatile, enables many different directions to take. With that
              being said, cloud computing is undoubtedly impactful at the very
              least to society as it had increased the competitiveness of IT
              services available to the public and private alike. This in turn
              creates a substantial number of opportunities leading to new
              services (more jobs), which further prove the versatility of cloud
              computing as a job and as a field itself. as long as there is
              internet connection, you can always use cloud services (either for
              storage or computing), so cloud computing affects us all as a
              whole rather than a niche in society.
            </p>
            <p>
              From a subjective point of view however, cloud computing had been
              a big help for me, especially since I am a programmer, and to be
              able to save your codes online is a luxury. I have always been
              used to cloud computing so my life is mostly unaffected with it,
              but without it, life can be quite troublesome. Cloud computing
              helps people stay in contact with each other, for example my
              friends and I, follow events or news, etc.
            </p>
            <h4>2. Cybersecurity and privacy</h4>
            <p>
              Cybersecurity, in its simplest term, is the practice of protecting
              programs, systems, and networks from digital attacks.
              Cybersecurity is a volatile field, with an “average 270 attacks
              per company over the year, a 31% increase over 2020. Third-party
              risk continues to dominate, with successful breaches to the
              organization through the supply chain have increased from 44% to
              61%” (D.H.James, 2020, p. 11). Cybersecurity ensures the privacy
              of users remain, “private”, this includes several actions to
              ensure minimum breach: prevention of unauthorized data/personnel;
              regulatory compliance; regular intervals of verifying data’s
              integrity; etc. The logarithmic growth rate of Cybersecurity has
              led many people to believe that AI will soon be the “core
              component of all cybersecurity, be it offline or online, systems”
              (D.H.James, 2020, p. 99). Cybersecurity was “invented” in the
              1970s, when two men – Bob “Creeper” Thomas and Ray “Reaper”
              Tomlinson – created two different programs – Creeper and Reaper
              respectively – to move over a network. Mr. Bob discovered that
              when a computer program moves over a network, it leaves behind a
              trail, he then created Creeper, so that the trail printed out a
              simple message “I’M THE CREEPER: CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.” This
              concerned a lot of people, including leading programming
              specialist of MIT – Ray Tomlinson- Ray then created Reaper for the
              sole purpose of catching and destroying Creeper.

              Cybersecurity prevents malicious actions (hacking) to be taken
              place in users’ devices. This in turns pushed the “hackers” to
              grow as a community, this also led to the inevitable growth of
              technologies in general. the growth of the black hat community
              will naturally lead to the growth of the cybersecurity community.
              This contrasting relationship is the fundamental push for the
              never-ending growth of technologies. Cybersecurity requires new
              services to be needed, therefore creating more jobs and
              opportunities to grow.
            </p>
            <p>
              The existence of cybersecurity serves not only as a beacon of
              “security”, but also a symbol of “changes”. Cybersecurity provides
              many people, including my family and I, online security, where
              almost all the people you’ve met or will eventually meet are
              strangers with different agendas. Personally, it had helped me and
              people I know going through my and their daily life, respectively,
              without worrying about being hacked or breached by random hackers.

            <h4>3. Autonomous vehicle</h4>
            <p>
              Autonomous vehicle, with a self-explanatory name, create and
              maintain a map of their surroundings based on a variety of sensors
              situated in different parts of the vehicle. Radar sensors monitor
              the position of nearby vehicles; video cameras detect traffic
              lights, read road signs, track other vehicles, and look for
              pedestrians and so on. This technology has been in development
              since the 1920s, with the first full-fledged autonomous vehicle –
              the AutoMobile – appeared around 1980s. There is a guiding
              framework of standards for measuring autonomous vehicle
              capabilities, with five levels of vehicle autonomy as defined by
              the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). They range from human
              control (level 0 autonomy) to full autonomous (level 5 autonomy).
              Tesla’s pilot, for example, is considered level 2 autonomy, which
              means a driver is still needed to takeover; while the Waymo
              project from Google operates at level 4 autonomy, meaning it is
              only 1 step away from being a true autonomous vehicle.
              Self-driving vehicles employ a wide range of technologies like
              radar, cameras, ultrasound, radio antennas, etc. to navigate
              safely on the roads.
            </p>
            <p>
              Autonomous has left behind massive impacts upon the job market,
              the general business, the health system and many more systems
              alike. Autonomous vehicle, like many other areas in IT, is growing
              exponentially. We’re expecting Tesla’s pilot, for example, to
              reach level 3 autonomy by the end of 2025. Autonomous vehicle had
              and will probably affect many jobs/fields. Autonomous vehicles can
              bring the end of truck drivers, taxi drivers, and so on, as there
              is not a need for a physical driver in order to takeover.
            </p>
            <p>
              Autonomous vehicle in general is not a big part of my life or my
              family. Soon, once the technology has been improved upon itself, I
              may just acquire it, purely out of curiosity.

            <h4>4. Chatbots</h4>
            <p>
              Chatbot is a computer program that stimulates a real life, human –
              hopefully natural – conversation. Users can interact with said
              chatbots via the chat interface or voice input. There are
              currently 3 main types. The simplest and probably the first type
              of chatbot invented - the rigid, multiple choices, rule-based
              chatbots. The others are more complicated. The Intellectually
              Independent Chatbots use machine learning to help them learn from
              users’ specific inputs and request – machine learning helps the
              bots recognize certain keywords that triggers certain replies,
              with the bots getting better and better overtime. The last and
              latest chatbots, which combined the best of both worlds, namely
              the rule-based bots and the machine learning bots, is called
              AI-powered chatbots. these latest models understand all languages,
              with their local memory works similarly like a cookie, saving both
              the context and the user’s preferences. These chatbots can also
              jump from one point of conversation scenario to another when
              needed and address random user request at any moment. In order to
              achieve this, these AI-Powered chatbots use a combination of
              machine learning, AI, and Natural Language Processing. NLP is the
              ability of the computer to understand and analyze human speech, to
              understand the inputted human language, therefore, find the right
              response and reply correctly to said human language. They have
              been widely considered as the “future of business communication”.
              This can be because businesses can now easily integrate chatbots
              into their social media channels to build customer relationships.
              This in turn, creates brand awareness and automate purchase
              processes, which can be very time and wit-consuming. With chatbots
              getting smarter the more they talk, thanks to AI and deep
              learning, said processes had become much simpler.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chatbots are important, especially to the people of the business
              world, where they are regarding it as the primary channel for
              marketing conversations. Since you can have chatbots talking to
              the users, without the need to pay for someone doing the job,
              chatbots had also negatively impacted society as “jobs regarding
              marketing have seen a sharp drop in the last quarter of 2014
              (total of -11%).” (J.D.Quagmire, 2019). Chatbots will get smarter
              and better overtime, because it can improve upon itself during
              real-time conversations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chatbots were not a big part of my experience growing up, neither
              was it present in my family throughout the years. I can only say
              chatbots, in its purest form, has helped many people overcome many
              things, or at the very least, had helped many businesses bloomed.

              After the discussion , the team come to the decision of a outfit
              costumize website that enables users to custom their own clothes.
              The website would include different types of clothes (or at least
              the most popular clothes pieces nowadays) with the customization
              including colors, shapes, small pieces of accessories, ... As the
              website’s purpose is to offer users chances to customize their own
              clothes according to their hobbies, it would also require a design
              department in order to create a successful website. This
              appearance is very important with this kind of website. The reason
              we think this website is interesting is that until now, there are
              still very few websites that enable users to customize their own
              clothes. This website give user opportunity to put their own style
              into the clothes. Everybody likes to own at least one piece of
              clothes that is unique and show their characteristics, their
              styles which no one can buy or find. The website would include a
              task bar with a large screen that presents the clothes design. The
              task bar would be placed on top of the website with different
              types of clothes such as pants, t-shirts, shirts, sweaters, ...
            </p>
            <p>
              As the users access the website, the first step is to choose what
              type of clothes they want to customize. As they click on the kind
              of clothes, the most basic image of that clothes would be
              presented on the customizing screen. At the bottom of the screen,
              at the same time, there will be a customizing bar displayed which
              might include colors for different parts of the clothes, shape,
              accessories and some simple images that users can choose to put on
              the clothes. The user can also insert the pictures from their
              devices to put on the clothes as their want according to their own
              style. We offers two main printing methods, screen printing and
              direct-to-garment (or digital) printing. Screen printing is the
              art of applying layers directly to a t-shirt, and
              direct-to-garment printing is handled by a garment printer that
              carefully applies ink to shirts. We promise to always use the best
              print method for your order’s unique needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              After finishing customizing their clothes, users can have a look
              at their finished product and decide to go to the payment process
              or not. If they have not yet satisfied with the products
              customized, users can always go back to the previous steps and
              start customizing their products again. If they have satisfied
              with the product and choose to pay for the clothes they make,
              customers can carry out the payment step and choose to take the
              product at the store or to have their products shipped. Other
              details needed to be included on the website probably the brand’s
              name (an unique name for the brand so that the customers can
              introduce to their friends if they want), contact details,
              including telephone number, email, address so that users can
              contact if they have any problems or questions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, there will be a report and contribution part for customers
              to send their reviews and comments to improve the experience for
              the users. There should also be a reviews part where customers can
              access and read reviews from other customers about the products as
              for online shopping, it is always very important to refer to
              comments and reviews before deciding to purchase something,
              especially clothes (customers always consider materials and the
              shape of There would be some foreseeable risk on the building
              stage of the project and the outcome as well. By hosting on
              GitHub, there will be no maintaining fee for the website. As the
              team have not had much experience, the coding member of the team
              had to learn new coding language to build the web. Furthermore,
              about the site responsive, we have to work on the desktop
              stylesheet and then the mobile styling later. At this stage, it
              would be difficult to rearrange layout of the elements. Our team
              still try our best to make the website standout from the other
              similar existed website and suitable for many user objects.

            <p>
              When I did assignment 2, my task is building the group website. I
              have to code everything from the beginning, so I face some
              problems which I have to do research online to solve. I have done
              our website 4 days before the deadline, but the content of the
              website is not completed. Although my team is not good at
              communication, all member tried their best to do the assignment on
              time. I think my team has to complete the next assignment as soon
              as possible to have time to review it before submitting it.
            </p>
            <span>Vu Phan Anh:</span>
            <p>
              Members are also quite candid and honest with one another, without
              being disrespectful, of course. My task is doing the Team Profile
              and the Project Idea so the main work I had to do is gathering
              information and do research about the idea of the team. The team
              did not have much time discussing as a whole group, which resulted
              in the lack connection in the team. Despite the fact that my team
              lacks communication skills, every member did their utmost to
              complete the task on time. My team should probably finish the next
              task as soon as feasible so that we may examine it before
              submitting it.

            <p>
              Everybody seemed to be quite well-coordinated, and thoughtful.
              Members are also very open and straightforward with each other, of
              course, without being rude. This acts as a fundamental force that
              drives all our team members forward; and thanks to that, we were
              able to complete the given tasks accordingly without much
              challenges.

            <span>Nguyen Ngoc Khanh Linh:</span>
            <p>
              Generally, after about nearly 1 month working together, I saw that
              our team worked quite well. We all finished our tasks in time with
              the planned deadlines and also there were no argument among
              teammates. However, I think there is 1 drawback is that we did not
              really communicate effectively as a team. We just did our tasks
              separately and handed them back listening to the feedback. It
              would be much better if we can talk and interact more. However,
              since we had to work with the geographical distance as we are not
              all in Ho Chi Minh city, it is quite understandable. <br />
              To be specific: <br />
              Thong: I saw he did quite well his job and as a senior, he did
              support and take care us quite thoroughly so that the tasks would
              finish on time. <br />
              Phan Anh: He also contributed ideas to the project and took care
              of other teammates. We did communicate during the project.
              <br />
              Huu Dat: He finished the tasks on time but I have got chances to
              communicate with him a lot, probably as we had to work online so
              the interaction is limited. <br />
              Myself: The tasks I was assigned were finished on time and also I
              feel like I did communicate and listen from others.
