            it did grow on me. Naturally since my interest didn’t particularly
            “spike up” at any point, but rather gradually increasing over time,
            there wasn’t a particular event of person that piqued my interest,

              For the assignment 3, the group’s work is still based on the idea
              from Assignment 2 : Outfit Customize Website. We have always
              managed to maintain a more-than-needed level of communication just
              for that extra security. Except for the fact that one team member
              is currently not in the city, we have always managed to talk to
              each other at least once a day every time we have a group project,
              not only in the group chat, but also to each other in our
              respective private Direct Messages. We usually do have a meeting
              twice a week with participations always numbered to a neat 100%
              via any app that is useful (Zoom, Messenger, NOT Skype, etc.). For
              example, if there is a group member that does not respond to our
              communications, we will first shoulder said person’s
              responsibilities equally among the rest of the active members,
              then, should they contact us back soon enough, we will let them
              handle that work, or at least an equal amount of work so that
              everything remains fair. Should they not contact us back though,
              we will file the usual report to make sure that they do not get
              the marks they deserve.

              Thong’s ideal job is Front-end Developer, which requires applicant
              to have knowledge in many coding languages and some kinds of
              framework such as Angular, 6 ReactJS, or Scrum. It is better if

              experience with HTML/CSS, Javascript and be able to update the
              latest of all technologies. <br />
              Linh and Phan Anh share the same ideal job which is Data Analyst.
              When a company hires an entry-level data analyst, employers know
              that they will have to teach this person all of the essential
              skills needed to be able to properly work within the company. This
              is also why many of these companies have special training programs
              that are designed explicitly for people looking for beginner data
              analyst jobs.All of that being said, specific entry-level data
              analyst requirements are still important to keep in mind. These
              requirements include possession of analytical and critical
              thinking skills, being well-suited to work in a team, being great
              at maths,… <br />
              Dat’s ideal job is Quantum Physicist, in short, the physics that
              explains how everything works. It explores the nature of the
              particles that make up matter and the sheer force with which they
              interact. It’s the study of matter and energy at the most core
              level — explaining how electrons move through a microchip or how
              the sun is a consistent ball of fire. To be a physics major,
              you’ll need a high school diploma, ACT or SAT scores, transcripts
              and letters of recommendation. Before declaring a major in
              physics, students are asked to complete coursework in general
              physics, algebra and calculus. <br />
              Those who are looking for a PhD programme in physics with a focus
              on quantum physics should have a strong undergraduate and master’s
              background in physics with sufficient coursework in the domain. To
              add to that, an interest in independent research or a bachelor’s
              degree from an accredited college or university is also needed.
              <br />
              The career plans of each member are different but they are all in
              the IT industry. All the jobs require to have soft skills such as

              Personally speaking, we think the audit trail did not properly
              reflect our group’s work, at least not the processes that happened
              in between production of our project. Instead of all members
              publishing their work into the public repository made by/for our
              group - which in turn may make it more difficult to navigate
              through said repository – we have decided to collect information
              and files via other methods, such as email, instant online
              messaging apps, etc. this way, only important data will be
              published into our group’s repository. It does, however, shows
              that our team has at the very least, completed the given tasks.

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              Topic <br />
              The website would include a task bar with a large screen that
              presents the clothes design. The task bar would be placed on top
              of the website with different types of clothes such as pants,
              t-shirts, shirts, sweaters, ... The website would include
              different types of clothes (or at least the most popular clothes
              pieces nowadays) with the customization including colors, shapes,
              small pieces of accessories, ... As the website’s purpose is to
              offer users chances to customize their own clothes according to
              their hobbies, it would also require a design department in order
              to create a successful website. This appearance is very important
              with this kind of website. <br />
              As the users access the website, the first step is to choose what
              type of clothes they want to customize. As they click on the kind
              of clothes, the most basic image of that clothes would be
              presented on the customizing screen. At the bottom of the screen,
              at the same time, there will be a customizing bar displayed which
              might include colors for different parts of the clothes, shape,
              accessories and some simple images that users can choose to put on
              the clothes. The user can also insert the pictures from their
              devices to put on the clothes as their want according to their own
              style. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Motivation <br />
              The reason we think this website is interesting is that until now,
              there are still very few websites that enable users to customize
              their own clothes. This website give user opportunity to put their
              own style into the clothes. Everybody likes to own at least one
              piece of clothes that is unique and show their characteristics,
              their styles which no one can buy or find. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Landscape <br />
              There are some typical Outfit customize websites that already
              existed such as customink.com, contrado.co.uk, spreadshirt.com,
              apliiq.com and a typical website that manufacturing in Vietnam is
              t-shirt-printing-vietnam.com. <br />
              These websites share a common thing is that they provide user to
              customize based on an existed product for only change the figure
              on the item. What make our website stands out is give user
              opportunity to have adjustment on the very detail parts of the
              outfits, which make the outfits unique. <br />
            </p>
            <h4>Detailed Description</h4>
            <p>
              Aims <br />
              The first intention of the team was only to working on the most
              feasible idea based on the team skills and abilities. The more we
              worked on the project, the more enthusiasm we put on the project.
              As the website provide user the easiest way to shopping clothes,
              with the unique and have not been developed before, we think the
              outcome website can probably change the way people shopping if it
              is developed intensively. <br />
              The aftermath of the Covid-19 outbreak has forced everyone to go
              online with their enterprises. People no longer like to purchase
              at a market or mall; instead, they prefer to search or browse
              online for new arrivals and accessories. This also allows them to
              save time and effort. A task bar with a large screen displaying
              the clothing design would be included on the website. The task bar
              would be placed on top of the website and would include various
              clothing items such as slacks, t-shirts, shirts, sweaters, and so
              on. When customers initially visit the website, they must first
              decide what style of clothing they want to create. When users
              select a type of clothing, the most basic image of that clothing
              is displayed on the customization screen. A customizing bar will
              be displayed at the bottom of the screen, which may include colors
              for different portions of the clothes, shape, accessories, and
              some simple graphics that users can pick to put on the outfits.
              The user has the option to insert figure and images from their
              mobile devices as well. Users can view their finished goods and
              decide whether or not to proceed to the payment procedure after
              finishing customizing their apparel. Users can always go back to
              the previous steps and start customizing their products again if
              they aren't content with the things they have created. Customers
              can complete the payment stage and choose whether to pick up their
              purchases in the store or have them mailed if they are satisfied
              with the product. <br />
              The process of customizing, checking, paying and shipping are
              provided to the users and how detail the users can customize as
              discussed above can really help us achieve our goal. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Plans and Progress <br />
              Each member of the group came up with different ideas for the
              group project at the start. According to the first and second
              assignments, each member has a different level of IT experience
              and interest. The ideas that we came up with from the start were
              an application for English learners, a science experiment
              simulator website, a website to create outfits, and a vector
              graphics application. Because only one team member has experience
              developing a website, we decided to build an Outfit customizable
              website, which will make it easy for the coding member while also
              being a practical notion. The reason we find this website
              intriguing is that there are still just a few websites that allow
              customers to personalize their own clothing. This website is
              fascinating since it allows users to personalize their outfits.
              Everyone wants to own at least one piece of clothing that is
              one-of-a-kind and reflects their personality and style in a way
              that no one else can. If people want to test their design ability
              and abilities, the website is also a location where they can use
              their ideas and creativity. <br />
              At the designing step, the team get worked together and decided
              what would displayed on the screen and what would happen as the
              users use the website. After that , the demo background of the
              website was presented in the presentation day and the other
              teammates kept working on the project to make it a completed
              website. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Roles <br />
              At the first stage of the project, the main thing the team was
              working on was the researching and designing to finish the demo to
              the project. At the first weeks, the group assigned jobs for each
              member to do the research on write the report. At the next step,
              Thong, the only member have much more experience in coding, worked
              mainly on the designing and building the website while other
              members continue on the writing and research part. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Scopes and limits <br />
              What we are aiming to do is simply working on introducing a more
              personalized “shopping” experience, specifically for people
              looking for an outfit that will scream out their name, an outfit
              that represents themselves when they put it on. The main basic
              thing that will need to be completed are basically the polishing
              process and smoothness of the website itself. So, the main product
              that we are going to introducing when it comes to “deliverability”
              of our project, will be a website that helps people customize
              clothes, with a sizable number of variants to choose from. <br />
              With that being said, there are a fair share of limits to our
              project. We do have lots of interesting ideas for this project,
              but since time is of the essence, we decided not to put some of
              them in as to not be over-ambitious and over-do what we were
              originally assigned to do (in a bad way). <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Testing <br />
              We have tested our project and proto-ran it a lot of times, mainly
              to polish it even further and beyond, to reach the stage that it
              deserved now. By testing, we simply ran the code for website, and
              to check for consistency error, validation error, etc. We have all
              tested it on people we personally know (that of course, have prior
              concrete knowledge about fashion) instead of normal acquaintances,
              which added up to 45 test users throughout 3 weeks (mid-Week 9 to
              mid-Week 12). We listened to the feedbacks and had further
              improved our website. <br />

            </p>
            <p>
              Risks <br />
              There are many risks, including: <br />
              • The website is not correctly optimized, in other words,
              suboptimal user interfaces with clunky and buggy client. <br />
              • The clothing is not “varied” enough, too monotonous. This is
              bound to happen, no matter how many pieces of unique clothing we
              will be able to obtain or at least manufactured, many people will
              have things to say about our “lack of unique clothing”. <br />
              • Many team members were not familiar with the technology at
              first, so there WAS a risk of one of us messing things up by,
              again, not being familiar with said technology. <br />
              • The project isn’t unique enough. This is more of a “generic”
              risk than any other, but still worth mentioning for the sole fact
              that our project may be uninteresting for some, especially those
              that do not care about how they look or what they wear. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Group processes and communications <br />
              We have always managed to maintain a more-than-needed level of
              communication just for that extra security. Except for the fact
              that one team member is currently not in the city, we have always
              managed to talk to each other at least once a day every time we
              have a group project, not only in the group chat, but also to each
              other in our respective private Direct Messages. We usually do
              have a meeting twice a week with participations always numbered to
              a neat 100% via any app that is useful (Zoom, Messenger, NOT
              Skype, etc.). For example, if there is a group member that does
              not respond to our communications, we will first shoulder said
              person’s responsibilities equally among the rest of the active
              members, then, should they contact us back soon enough, we will
              let them handle that work, or at least an equal amount of work so
              that everything remains fair. Should they not contact us back
              though, we will file the usual report to make sure that they do
              not get the marks they deserve. <br />

              Although we have some problems when we did assignment 3, my group
              still completed this assignment. In this assignment, we had done
              the design of the project and had a detailed plan for building
              this app. We had to design and plan for our website, we did not
              have enough time to create a real website. If we have more time
              and fundamental knowledge about the website, we could build a demo
              of our project and show it in submission. Initially, I did not
              think we can plan or design our ideas because we have never done
              this before. We still did assignment 3 as well as possible, so I
              hope my group can get a high score for this assignment. When I did
              the assignment with my group, I had learned many things from my
              teammates. I found that the important and essential thing when
              people work in a team is the connection.

              In a team-oriented environment, everyone contributes to the
              group's overall success. Eveyone collaborates with other members
              of the group to complete the tasks at hand. Having the proper
              people in the right jobs is a key aspect in determining the
              success of a team, where you work together to achieve the major
              objectives. Through the past 2 assignments, the team restricted to
              the assigned roles to each members. Members are also open and
              honest with one another, but not to the point of being insulting.
              My assignment included creating a Team Profile and a Project
              Description, thus the most of my time was spent gathering
              information and conducting research on the team's concept. To have
              the work done, I had to research for the IT trend and market
              around the project idea, which is Outfit customize website. Three
              members of the group had improved a lot in communication skills,
              and we worked together on the presentation. Dat did not discuss
              and work much with other members, but he could still get the work
              done and on time. Therefore, the main task of the project was to
              build a website, the team base skills did not meet the requirement
              to really achieve the set goal. The project and the whole course
              help m learn lot of new skills and aspects needed for future
              career. Communication skill, academic writing, researching and
              presentation skill are the soft skills that really required at any
              future employee. The project provided us opportunity to really go
              through the process of building a website, get to know more about
              the IT trend and IT system.

              Everybody seemed to be quite well-coordinated, and thoughtful.
              Members are also very open and straightforward with each other, of
              course, without being rude. This acts as a fundamental force that
              drives all our team members forward; and thanks to that, we were
              able to complete the given tasks accordingly without much
              challenges.

              What went well during the last assignment is that we all did our
              assigned tasks and finished them on time. We all spent time doing
              research to complete our tasks well. However, the outcome would be
              better if we spent more time and start our last assignment earlier
              and especially if we had had more interaction and communication.
              However, I have learnt a little about how to collaborate in a
              group and learn the communication skills needed for effective
              teamwork. I have gained quite a lot of experience working in this
              team.
